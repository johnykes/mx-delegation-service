1. Redis Server is required to be installed [docs](https://redis.io/).

It depends on the following external systems:
- gateway:
    - provides access to node information, such as network settings, delegation contract configs, staking providers settings, etc
    - docs: https://docs.elrond.com/sdk-and-tools/proxy/
- index:
    - a database that indexes data that can be queries, such as transactions, blocks, delegators, etc.
    - docs: https://docs.elrond.com/sdk-and-tools/elastic-search/

It uses on the following internal systems:
